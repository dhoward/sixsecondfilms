    %p Welcome to the Six Second Film Festival. Here's how to play:
    %p Go to the app store and download Vine. 

    %p Every hour, will post a new festival subject. These subjects are available on the top line of the site, and by following @6secfilms on twitter.

    %p Your job is to make a short film using vine and post it to twitter with the hashtag of that hour's festival subject. 

    %p The films with the most retweets one hour later get posted here             .

    %p For example, if the 3pm festival subject is "one of the characters must be a pirate" you have until 4pm to post your pirate movie with the hashtag #pirate6sf.

    %p At 5pm, all the vine movies on twitter with the hashtag #pirate6sf will be counted and the movies with the most retweets win. 

    %p Enjoy the show.
